# Course Summary: C and Assembly Programming

This repository contains code and projects related to the C and Assembly programming course I completed at Ben-Gurion University. In this course, I gained knowledge and practical experience in various aspects of programming, memory management, and working with operating systems. The following sections provide an overview of the topics covered in the course.

## Topics Covered

### C Programming

- Variables, loops, and control structures: Learned the fundamentals of programming using C, including working with variables, implementing loops (e.g., `for`, `while`, `do-while`), and using if-else statements for conditional branching.
- Memory structure: Gained an understanding of how memory is organized and managed in C programs, including the stack, heap, and static memory.
- Pointers and arrays: Explored the concepts of pointers and arrays in C, understanding their relationship and how they can be used for efficient memory access and manipulation.
- Structs and data structures: Learned how to define and use structs to create complex data structures, enabling the representation of more intricate data models in C programs.
- File I/O and streams: Worked with file input/output operations and streams in C, including reading from and writing to files, as well as handling standard input/output streams.
- Makefiles: Acquired knowledge of creating and utilizing Makefiles to automate the build process of C programs, managing dependencies, and compiling projects.
- Interprocess communication: Explored the use of pipes for interprocess communication, enabling data exchange between different processes in a synchronized manner.
- Command-line interface: Developed programs that interact with the terminal, accepting command-line arguments, parsing input, and providing appropriate output.
- Redirection and pipelines: Gained an understanding of redirecting input and output streams in Linux, allowing for communication between programs using pipelines.

### Assembly Programming

- Registers and program structure: Explored the assembly programming language, focusing on working with registers, understanding their roles, and utilizing them efficiently to manipulate data.
- Labels and control flow: Learned about labels and how they are used for control flow in assembly programs, including conditional jumps, loops, and function calls.
- Function frames: Gained an understanding of function frames and the stack, including the process of entering and exiting functions, managing local variables, and parameter passing.

## Operating Systems

Throughout the course, practical assignments and projects were performed on the Linux operating system. Working on Linux provided a hands-on experience with system-level programming, shell scripting, and utilizing the features and utilities provided by the Linux environment.

## Course Projects

The course involved various programming assignments and projects, allowing me to apply the concepts and skills learned. Some notable projects include:
//todo : add labs tasks
- **Project 1**: 


Please note that this README provides only a high-level overview of the topics covered and the projects completed during the course. The actual code and detailed project descriptions can be found in the respective directories within this repository.
